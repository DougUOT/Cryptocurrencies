# Cryptocurrencies
Use unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data

## Project Overview

We have the chance to pitch an investment in cryptocurrencies to the firm Accountability Accounting. We know that bitcoin's popularity has caused a cost hop that makes it exorbitant for some new investors. In any case, there are many cryptocurrencies accessible at more reasonable costs. We will discover trends that will convince the firm to invest in these new currencies. This project is perfect for applying unsupervised machine learning.

We will work on how to process data to use an unsupervised model. We will work primarily with the K-means algorithm, the main unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data into clusters. We will build on this by speeding up the process using principal component analysis (PCA), which employs many different features. Finally, we will make our models more efficient using principal component analysis.
